    <p style="padding: 30px;" margin="20px"><b>Maharashtra</b> (/məhɑːˈrɑːʃtrə/; Marathi: [məhaɾaːʂʈɾə] (listen), abbr. 
        MH or Maha) is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India and the second-most populous country subdivision globally. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State, which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat. Maharashtra is home to the Marathi people, the predominant ethno-linguistic group,
         who speak the Marathi language, the official language of the state. </p><hr>

            is the third-largest state by area in terms of land area and constitutes 9.36 per cent of India's total geographical area.
