    <p style="padding: 30px;" margin="20px" >In the early 17th century, <b>Shahaji Bhosale</b> an ambitious local general who had served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate,
        the Mughals and Adil Shah of Bijapur at different periods throughout his career, attempted to establish his independent rule.[41]
         <b>His son Shivaji</b> succeeded in establishing the <b>Maratha Empire</b>  which was further expanded during the 18th century by the Bhat family Peshwas based in Pune.[42] The Marathas under the Peshwas, Bhonsale of Nagpur, Gaekwad of Baroda, 
         Holkar of Indore, Scindia of Gwalior and Puars of Dewas and Dhar defeated the Mughals and conquered large territories in the northern and central parts of the Indian subcontinent. At its peak, the Maratha empire covered much of the subcontinent, encompassing a territory of over 2.8 million km2.
          The Marathas are credited to a large extent for ending the Mughal rule in India.[43][44][45] After their defeat at the hand of Ahmad Shah Abdali's Afghan forces in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Maratha suffered a setback. However, they soon reclaimed the lost territories and ruled central and n
          orth India including New Delhi until the end of the eighteenth century. The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817â€“1818) led to the end of the Maratha Empire and the East India Company took over the empire.[46][47] The Marathas also developed a potent Navy circa in the 1660s, which at its peak, dominated the territorial 
          waters of the western coast of India from Mumbai to Savantwadi.[48] It resisted the British, Portuguese, Dutch,
           and Siddi naval ships and kept a check on their naval ambitions. 
         The Maratha Navy dominated till around the 1730s,
          was in a state of decline by the 1770s and ceased to exist by 1818.[49]</p><hr>
